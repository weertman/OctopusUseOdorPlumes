### Abstract
This study presents the first laboratory observations of octopuses performing chemosensory-plume-guided navigation to locate food sources. Using a custom-built octopus-safe flume and infrared imaging, we demonstrate that *Octopus rubescens* employs odor-gated rheotaxis and exhibits characteristic fast arm-aligned motions (FAAM) during chemosensory tracking. Our findings suggest that octopus arms and suckers serve as the primary chemosensory organs driving this behavior.
